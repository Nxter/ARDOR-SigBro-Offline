## Description

SIGBRO OFFLINE is a lightweight, downloadable tool for the Ardor blockchain platform. It is designed to keep your passphrase (private key) safe by letting you create accounts, sign transactions, and perform other transactions on Ardor parent chain / Ardor child chain in a secure, offline environment.

SIGBRO OFFLINE easily allows you to:
 - Create an account
 - Print an account paperwallet
 - Generate QR codes for your account and passphrase
 - Sign Unsigned Transaction Bytes with your passphrase (air gap)
 - Prove ownership of your account (generate tokens from passphrase)

In other words, this is ideal for making cold storage accounts and for setting up SIGBRO MOBILE.

Why is SIGBRO OFFLINE the most secure way to store your cryptocurrency?

Private keys stored on a device connected to the internet are vulnerable to network-based theft. With SIGBRO OFFLINE you can safely store your crypto/tokens, lease your ARDR forging power, and otherwise make transactions of any kind on the Ardor network, without ever exposing your private key (account passphrase) to potentially vulnerable networks.

The safest way to store cryptocurrency is by using a paper wallet; the safest way to make transactions is by signing them offline and then broadcasting the Signed Transaction Bytes online. Hackers cannot steal your passphrase or your digital assets when you are not connected to the internet.

You can broadcast signed Nxt and Ardor transactions here: [nxter.org/wallet](https://nxter.org/wallet) or by using any private or public node on the network.

You and you alone are responsible for keeping your passphrase and cryptocurrency safe. If you lose your private key (account passphrase), then you lose your funds, because you can not access them without your private key. SIGBRO OFFLINE does NOT store your passphrase in any form!

SIGBRO OFFLINE is open source software under the MIT license and is part of the SIGBRO software bundle developed by [Nxter.org](https://www.nxter.org).

P.S. Still cautious about using this tool? Still concerned your account passphrase will be exposed? A simple test is to use your browser’s “developers tools” functionality and go to the “Network” tab to see the requests that SIGBRO OFFLINE makes.
