 - Sign Unsigned Transaction Bytes with your passphrase (air gap)                                                                                                       
 - Prove ownership of your account (generate tokens from passphrase)                                                                                                    

In other words, this is cool for making cold accounts and for setting up SIGBRO MOBILE.                                                                                 

Why SIGBRO OFFLINE is the most secure way to store crypto?                                                                                                              

Private keys stored on a device connected to the internet are vulnerable to network-based theft. With SIGBRO OFFLINE you can store your tokens safely, lease your ARDR forging power, and make transactions of any kind on the Ardor network, without ever exposing your private key (account passphrase) to the network.                       
                                                                                                                                                                        
The safest way to store cryptocurrency is using a paper wallet, the safest way to make transactions is signing them offline, and then broadcasting the signed transaction bytes online. Hackers can not steal your passphrase or your digital assets when you are not connected to the internet.                                                
                                                                                                                                                                        
You and you alone are responsible for keeping your passphrase and cryptocurrencies safe. If you ever lose your private key (passphrase), then you lose your funds, because you can not access them without your private key. SIGBRO keeps no backup.
